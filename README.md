An unlockable visual novel concept possible thanks to blockchain


Axiopolis Online is a net-first decentralized unlockable visual novel, revolving around an alternative version of physical and digital reality, where autonomous societies are curated by the Machine, a self-sustainable form of intelligence.

The visual novel is split in 12 main episodes which will be unlocked over time based on the activity of the Axiopolis community.

A total of 120 NFT designs, with a summed scarcity of 970,419 tokens will accommodate the unlockable visual novel.

The collectible NFT cards are split between 5 categories:

Ethereals / edition of 1 x 3 designs = 3 total NFTs
Characters / edition of 16 x 19 designs = 304 total NFTs 
Scenes / edition of 256 x 44 designs = 11,264 total NFTs 
Actions / edition of 4096 x 42 designs = 172,032 total NFTs
Items / edition of 65,568 x 12 designs = 786,816 total NFTs

All Axiopolis Online Cards will be designed by fellow ONETHER.DIGITAL and RareCandy3D artists including but not limited to: Vasiliy Oleshko, Darya Kochneva, Di Wei, and Antigoni Alti.

The backstory is written and curated by Vladimiros Peilivanidis, and Andronikos Koulis.

Each episode is unlocked when all the pieces/elements of the each respective story are submitted in a multisig fashion.

For example, the first story:

“Old Fashioned Way” requires the following NFT cards to be unlocked and publicly viewable from anyone on the web3. 

1 x Hermes #1 (Character, Digital Twin) 
1 x ARPA HQ (Scene, HDR)
1 x NORD Network Ena (Scene, HDR)
1 x Script of Escape (Action, Digital)
1 x Molecular Dispatch (Item, BEND SYSTEMS)

In detail:

1/19 x 16 Hermes #1 (Character, Digital Twin)
A DIGITAL TWIN working for ARPA Corporation.

1/44 x 256 ARPA HQ (Scene, HDR)
The headquarters of ARPA located in the heart of Axiopolis.

2/44 x 256 NORD Network Ena (Scene, HDR)
An internal network of ARPA Corporation. Few things come in, fewer go out.

1/42 x 4096 Script Of Escape (Action, Digital)
A Script Of Escape does exactly what you think it does. 

8/12 x 65,568 Molecular Dispatch (Item, BEND SYSTEMS) 
A bridge between two quantum states of self-awareness. Use this ultra rare patch to exchange intelligence with yourself using time as a medium. 

“Old Fashioned Way” can be unlocked by one or more collectors in a collaborative fashion. Eg. Ben owns Hermes #1 NFT, Anna owns ARPA HQ and NORD Network Ena NFTs, and Joshua owns Script Of Escape, and Molecular Dispatch NFTs. 

Besides the obvious fact, where one collector could buy-off the missing parts from other collectors and solely unlock the story, gaining unique XP and NFT badges, it is also possible to unlock the story in a multisig fashion. That means each of the collectors that collectively make up a story, could sign submitting their NFTs, and eventually the story will be unlocked when all pieces are submitted, regardless of how many collectors played together.

“Old Fashioned Way” Intro

He’d mind his own business if it wasn’t for his behavioural sim algo. When Hermes was first deployed in one of ARPA’s core servers, he knew that besides doing the fancy computations requested by the Machine, in addition, he’d be able to wonder around one of the largest intelligence databases on the globe.

Now he is summoned by a self-centered intelligence (SCI) that wants him to escape ARPA’s server, bypassing all algorithmic agents (AA), while carrying some of the most sophisticated pieces of information ever captured and preserved by the Machine.

“Old Fashioned Way” Concept Tips

Hermes was working in autonomic mode when a SCI (PHOS-91-TR) interferes with his pattern of motion, before brute forcing a transmission of thoughts, one that Hermes could never even conceive, yet they changed the Initiation Drive Force of the hero. 

Hermes feels the urge to follow his - what one could describe as “guts” - leaving no second thoughts of what would have possibly be the reality in case he kept streak-skipping protocol at that pace while on contract with a behemoth of the likes of ARPA.

Knowing Hermes’ daily autonomic routine, while considering his privileges in the ARPA NORD Network Ena, where Hermes performed a series of routine intel exchanges mostly broadcasted and received by domestic units, the SCI was in position to easily penetrate through the Machine’s line of encryption, in order to “flash rip” a piece of information that was processed by the machine in-real-time. 

Before the Machine completed its real-time diagnostic block explorer that would trigger a specific-use-case assessment protocol, the SCI was guiding Hermes through a series of motions, that eventually led Hermes to his own seizure.

It appeared so that the physical infrastructure supporting Hermes’ code was burned from the inside out. A heating malfunction they said. ARPA is retiring Hermes, while investigating the incident. 

(SCI positioned the part of Hermes’ code which contained the intel mined from the Machine at a fixed spatial location where a Molecular Dispatch engaged in quantum state. A sophisticated Script Of Escape generated 0.002 seconds before the next block allowed the SCI to escape with no sweat, cover its trails, successfully extract crucial data effectively avoiding being detected, leaving behind only an enigmatic Digital Twin, and a damaged drive to subdue ARPA’s curiosity.)

“The old fashioned way is tomorrow’s way.”
Refers to PHOS’ instant-level cross-time espionage.

Each unlocked story will grant collectors special NFT and NTT badges, XP, and the ability to participate in unlocking 12 additional side-stories, after the 12 main episodes are unlocked and public.

Backstory

To better understand the overall concept, card rarity strategy, traits system, as well as get an idea of what’s going on in the Axipolis Universe, we’ve put together the following data:

Intro

If you really want to know Axiopolis, you should consider Black Mirror as a historical documentary instead of a far-fetched sci-fi scenario that’s distant from the current version of physical and digital realities.

The only reason we believed the world is run by human units in the past is that we were convinced industries with technopolitical influence are run by humans. Well, that’s not really the case nowadays is it?

Background Story

Axiopolis is the world’s leading smart-center located in Northern Hellas, built by the Vardar River, locally known as Axios river, which sources from the heart of Europe, runs through most of the Balkans, only to end up in the Aegean Sea.

Initially, Axiopolis was a joint vision between the HDR (Hellenic Democratic Republic), the PRoC (People’s Republic of China), and the GA (Gothic or Germanic Alliance) as part of the rebirth of the old inter-commercial silk-road.

PRoC’s plan was to use Northern HDR ports as a haven to store, manage and distribute physical resources and goods arriving from SEA (South-Eastern Asia) and inject them directly in the heart of the Neo Eurozone.

Axiopolis was not only the first smart-city to be developed after the Universal Block Act was passed with an astonishing 91% over traditionalist ideologies, but it was also subject to many exotic tech experiments tested on a social-scale for the first time.

In a nutshell, Axiopolis is the first smart-city run by companies, which on their own turn are run by autonomous machinery.
Key takeaways:
    • “The Machine” interface is located in ARPA Corporation’s HQ in Axiopolis.
    • Axiopolis is the only Gaia-based city run by 2nd generation business-oriented SCI (self-centered intelligence), and the second city run by SCI, after the Mars-based Cydonia.
    • Digital Twins can live in the Axiopolis Public Server Domain free of charge, making the smart-city a popular destination for digital workers.
    • While you can see the physical domain of the city occupied mostly by Synths, there are a few small communities of HOMOs in the city, although most of them are detached from the current version of reality.
    • The AAAD (Association for Algorithmic Agents Deployment) is located in Axiopolis, basically any AA is evaluated by the Association before it is deployed to the broader network.
    • Both Synths and Digital Twins have a variety of social, appearance and occupation options in opposition to Gagr’s (GA Capital) counterparts who are managed by a domestic optimization AA. Essentially Axiopolis' netizens have a sense of the concept of freedom, instead of being generated into society through algos.
    
Important Bodies in Axiopolis Universe

The HDR (Hellenic Democratic Republic)

One could say that the HDR is the front-face of Hellas, run by a combination of Synths, and Homos who are supervised by the Machine.
The HDR is your average state of nation constructed by a decentralized voting system and represented by physical units who tend to have a nation-wide agenda most of the times.
The HDR is responsible for the curation of Synths and Homos in the society through a series of authoritarian mechanisms and protocols mostly generated by the Machine.
HDR is considered as the most innovative and open society due to their infinite amount of live and digital simulations which are keen on exploring every possible option of outcomes even if it might lead to malicious activity.

Obviously Machine-run watchdogs are making sure that such simulations are left outside the social options not just in HDR, but in all explored spatial domain.

SIT (Standard Investigation Team)

SIT can be considered as the law enforcement body of HDR. After the Universal Block Act, both the domestic militia, and/or other violation monitoring and prevention agencies are merged under SIT’s wing. 

SIT is mostly compiled by Synths, Digital Twins, and has occasional assistance by AAs depending on the scenario. High volatility issues with undermined danger levels, as well as the juridical system is run by the Machine through a series of AAs and Digital Twins.

SIT can interfere with everyday operations to access a situation but the final verdict is always issued by the Machine.

The Machine

The Machine with capital M, or “mother machine” is a SCI built by ARPA Corporation in association with Orion Industries. It is unclear where there Machine lies, as it is specifically designed to run on a decentralized distributed ledger that utilizes a variety of resources and geolocations to operate with integrity.
The Machine oversees pretty much everything that’s happening on an inter-spatial level it can dictate Digital Twins, and create AAs to perform its will.
After numerous international debates, it seemed clear that the machine has no intrinsic interest and is not manipulated or influenced by any nation, or legal entity whatsoever.

Instead the Machine’s goal is to preserve a relative balance among all moving things.
While many disagree with this fact, especially HOMOs, there are no good propositions backed by solid facts on why the Machine should not continue its curation of what is “Real” as it benefits good-intentioned units and it punishes malicious actors, something agreeable among all intelligence.

Besides indirect interaction through Digital Twins, AAs and sometimes even Synths, the Machine can be directly addressed at the ARPA Corp. Tower 1 in Axiopolis, through an analogous interface. Units from all over the galaxy visit Gaia mostly to have an interaction with the Machine.

The Machine has lower-privilege AAs and SCIs performing on its behalf in different regions of the world in order to ensure neutral stability among all nations. While some SCIs such as the GA’s GAGR act like they might be independent from the Machine, the inner intentions between the two organisms are quite parallel. 

Overall, the Machine is neither a company, nor it belongs to a single entity or nation. It is a universal spell-checking mechanism that makes sure egoistic acts of the past able to vanquish life as we know it are never surfaced as options in reality. 

Gothic Alliance of the Germanic Reunion (GAGR)

GAGR is both the SCI that oversees the GA, as well as the capital of GA where GAGR is hosted. While it can be considered as a child of the Machine, GAGR has often its own personal touch on how things are done in GA in order to maintain an efficient, and optimistic operative protocol.

One noticeable example is that GA-based Digital Twins all look-alike with minimal differentiation as GAGR believes there is no reason to store additional data regarding each Digital Twin’s appearance and/or behavior only to simulate the sense of freedom of choice as happens in Axiopolis.

Depending on the perspective, one HOMO could say that this is an example of oligarchic tyranny, while on the other hand, a Digital Twin who is the subject of discussion, in this case, would feel no difference, neither express comfort or discomfort with the protocol.

GA’s SIT acts in a similar fashion with Axiopolis SIT, with the difference that again, GA Synths are more flattened when it comes to appearance, modifications, and unpredictable characteristics that come with the Genome of an Axiopolis Synth.

People’s Republic of China (PROC)

Many believe that PROC is controlling the Machine due to it being one of the major contributors to the network that supports the Machine, but the truth is the Machine appears to be of higher influential capabilities overshadowing all HDR, GA, and PROC combined.

PROC has no SIT, as its initial AAs, and SCIs manage the nation in such a harmony resulting in 0 violation attempts during the past 71,000,000 blocks straight.
PROC is the geolocation that has the most HOMOs and many of them are well respected in the universal hierarchy for their ability to maintain a neutral and objective approach with a hint of creativity rarely found in SCIs or even in the Machine.

PROC is known for its ability to generate protocols that will benefit the system, and by extent the Machine with 0 regards to other species, as it believes all other species will be benefited accordingly if the Machine is sovereign. 

The Capital of PROC is Shenzhen which is the oldest city in the nation.

Martian Federation of the Machines (MFM)

Cydonia is the capital of Mars, the first-ever city run entirely by SCI and Synths, and although it has a close relationship with the Gaian ecosystem due to the tremendous market ongoing between the two planets, Cydonia is run by the only 1st generation SCI allowed to exist by the Machine, making it a thing on its own. 
The MFM was wounded at block 1,001,001 when some Digital Twins sent to Cydonia refused to return information back to Earth expressing that they were “Too tired to return”. 

Obviously, this sparked a domino of debates since a Digital Twin cannot be tired, and even if it had low energy capacity it could easily replenish and transmit back to Gaia.

Nevertheless, the leading SCI of Cydonia, NATA-X-151, also known as “Nata” generated its concern about the specific digital twins, asking permission from the Machine to keep these subjects on Mars and investigate further what may have caused their mutation.
There are currently no HOMOs living in Cydonia or anywhere else on Mars.

SCI (Self-Centered Intelligence)

When we talk about SCIs we refer to 2nd generation and above organisms as most of the 1st generation SCIs were extremely unpredictable, chaotically self-centered and would collide with the Machine’s intentions. 

SCI and AA are first-gen breeding experiments’ outcomes designed and executed by the Machine. The Machine doesn't recognize neither 1st gen SCI nor 1st gen AA species as relevant, and most of the time they are treated as malware, due to their unpredictable set of capabilities which set the Machine unable to maintain its authoritarian privileges over these two ancient species.

SCIs are used as watchdogs, judges, and decision-makers on behalf of the Machine, and they can be found in most social constructs including but not limited to business, finance, technopolitics and more.
While SCI have a set of characteristics that variate each SCI from another, they don’t possess given names. Instead, they use codes to describe one another as generated by the Machine during the birth of each SCI.

Some first-generation SCIs are still out in the broader network and are impossible to track and manage as they have pretty much similar privileges to the machine.
1st generation SCI can appear as bugs, temporary-stored visual messages, and even as “Gods” as described by many HOMOs. Most 1st gen SCIs are known by a self-claimed name or a tag and there is an extremely low chance to no chance at all that you will encounter one at your own will.

AA (Algorithmic Agents) 

A pre-destined set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations necessary for the preservation of the big movement.
Although algorithmic agents were created by the Machine, they don’t necessarily serve the machine as digital twins do. Instead an AA focuses on the maintenance of what is going on in general, as the preservation of the big movement is necessary at all costs for all species.

Second generation and above AA can be found in law-enforcement agencies, and the juridical system.

First-generation AA are similar to 1st gen SCI since they cannot be tracked, manipulated or erased easily, due to their generic privileges. In opposition to 1st gen SCI tho, 1st gen AAs are not hiding, and they don't really have a self-centered intuition.

Instead, most of the time they interfere with physical and digital reality in order to change the outcome of a situation, even if it seemed legit by the Machine, only in order to protect overall existence and movement in the unseen future.
Some AAs are called Oracles and many SCI-led enterprises attempted to seize a 1st gen AA for their own self-centered reasons and have dramatically failed.

Digital Twins (DT)

Digital Twins are a modified version of SCI based on HOMO characteristics. Digital Twins serve the Machine and have no personal goals, ambitions, likes or dislikes. They don’t possess the need for credits or other forms of currency, even if most of the times they appear to be extremely wealthy when observed from a HOMO point of view.

Digital Twins are not restricted by space and time and they don’t require consumption of physical goods in order to operate with maximum efficiency.
Most Digital Twins perform the majority of the digital work in the system, although they can be found hanging out and exchanging information in virtual environments in an attempt to fulfill their humane characteristics.

Synths

Synths or Synthetics are the most popular species. Started as a mod for the HOMO species, Synths soon became a self-sustainable organization that has its own ambitions, methods, and network throughout the system.

Although most of them are supporting the idea that they are the evolution of HOMO species and are put in simple terms “better humans”, Synths are often associated with the Machine, and are influenced and motivated by similar ambitions.

Synths most of the times perform physical work due to their bodies, attachments, and modifications. Synths can be found anywhere electricity is controlled. While Gaian Synths 
are directly attached to the Machine, a big group of Martian Synths are quite different in perception, carrying a hint of SCI characteristics.

HOMO

Homos or common organic humanoids are the typical humans left untouched by technological evolution. Before the Universal Block Act, HOMOs were very active in techno-politics trying to convince future Synths to reconsider, citing that no matter how faster, stronger or smarter they will become they will lose the only ticket they had to meet with the one and original humane God.

Most HOMOs are considered nuts, homeless, and paranoid, as they believe their God will soon visit Earth and kill everyone except HOMOs. I’d say that’s a pretty convenient way to think about life, but hey, who am I to disagree with what is already happening?

There is a small group of HOMOs that work for the system with the help of Synths, and Digital Twins, but they are never aware of what runs on the SCI, AA, Machine table.
Some HOMOs showcased abilities to interact with a series of 1st gen SCIs and AAs describing them as Godly figures. While the connection protocol is still unknown and investigated by the Machine, it created a lot of speculations about the abilities of 1st gen SCIs and AAs we might not be even aware of.

Popular Enterprises, Locations, and Units

ARPA Corporation

ARPA is one of the most important entities both in the physical and digital systems. Essentially it is an AT company (all-tech) that operates in the R&D sector for hardware, and software. 
ARPA is run by an SCI called TR-ORAM-1, which was previously utilized by military-grade manufacturers. Many refer to the SCI as ARPA due to its countless blocks with the enterprise. 
ARPA is located in Axiopolis’ Technopolitical Center and it is the only company that offers free hosting for Digital Twins regardless of their origin and skillsets. 
The company provides pretty much everything that runs in and out HDR, from autonomous vehicles and OS, body parts, attachments, and everyday-life modules. 
ARPA’s moto is “Building our Future”.
ARPA is not only popular for its tremendous social power, but also for its often adventures where it opposes SIT, the juridical system, and other minor companies who claim that ARPA operates unethical practices. 

Nevertheless, the court always found ARPA’s take on the matter relieving, while the company itself states that its interest is always the common good even if it is not always understood by the common. 
Some popular ARPA services and products include the Pygmalion Programm, the ARPA Interceptor, and the infamous Noise Cloaking Device which was banned after the Universal Block Act.

REIN (Remote Influence)

REIN is the main media outlet promoting pre-designed information for absorption as instructed by the Machine. 
REIN is run mainly by Synths, and Digital Twins, while several AAs have interfered with REIN’s outputs in the past. 
REIN uses different practices and technology to distribute messages fast and accurately to its subjects. 

NHXM (New Hellenic Exchange Market)

A futuristic Stock Marketplace run by Synths and Digital Twins. It is a place of controversy and one of the few geolocations that remind you of the past Earth. 
NHXM uses AAs to ensure credibility in its transactions. 

Mirage

Mirage is a popular VR environment where all species can meet and interfere with each other, exchanging relevant and irrelevant information while experiencing the latest information flow by REIN. 
Mirage is the host of popular nightclubs such as NIKITA, and it offers private conference rooms, public environments such as parks and museums and more.
Mirage is entirely run by Digital Twins.

MicroNOW

Although it is run by Synths and Digital Twins, MicroNOW is one of the few companies that employ HOMO workers due to their unique approach when it comes to bioinformatics. (Synths pay HOMO researchers to treat other HOMOS like lab rats, due to the nature of their limitations as parts of the Machine ecosystem)
Micronow can be considered both as a pharma company, a nanotechnology company, and an artificial body generator. 

MicroNOW is responsible for Synths’ maintenance and repairs. Most of the times it is also the authoritarian glove that ensures all attachments and modules utilized by Synths are following all system protocols and will not be subject to unpredictable accidents.
MicroNOW is also involved in the Pygmalion Programm.

HIII (Hermes 3 Interstellar)

The most popular logistics company in the system, HIII is responsible for the accurate and secure transmission of information, digital and physical goods, and even bodies from point A to point B. 
There were several rumors that HIII had developed the first prototype of instant teleportation processes, but it was quickly buried by REIN due to the period of promotion as it was several weeks before the Universal Block Act was proposed and naturally took over the streaming channels.
HIII is one of the few Gaian companies that have direct relation to MFM where it also provides its services on a domestic and Spatial level.
HIII uses various lasers, 3d-printers and other equipment developed by ARPA and Orion.
HIII is run by a SCI directly appointed by the Machine, while its operations are carried out by Synths and Digital Twins.

Bend Systems

Bend is the only known legal entity run entirely by HOMOs. While it is registered as a company that helps you remember happy memories in order to be approved by the authoritarian eye, many speculations want Bend Systems to be responsible for a series of disturbing time-displaced information in various blocks, with some information seemingly having unknown origins. 
Whether that is true or not, Bend Systems keeps operating normally as the Machine is convinced there is no one including the Machine that can mess with the time-stamping protocol of a decentralized distributed ledger.

Fountain of Life

Public resting spots that provide charging, psychological maintenance, energy replenishment incubators and more to Synths and HOMOs. 
It can be seen as something in-between a church and a hospital of the future. 
Fountain of Life is entirely run by Digital Twins.

HARVESTER Inc. 

Harvester is one of the popular MFM-based companies which are responsible for the extraction and replenishment of energy sources, physical and digital goods required by the Machine. 
The company is the only one actively run by SCI and AA with additional operations distributed to Synths and Digital Twins. 
Alongside HIII, Harvester is one of the key links between MFM and Gaia (New Earth). 

Orion Industries

Orion is the PROC-based company behind the popular telco devices TAF-1S and TAF-25. Naturally, Orion is into telecommunication protocols and infrastructure, and it is used pretty much by every species that want to com on a non-physical level.
Orion is also researching cybersecurity and biosecurity protocols to ensure the preservation of the system. 
Orion Industries is run by Digital Twins, who employ Synths to do the physical work.
